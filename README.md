## Nerd's thinking
### Gains:
- Simple to design
- No requirement for other library support

### Pains:
- The logic behind the game was relatively complicated
- Double values of Ace was the key but also a Bug's hotbed for the program
- Too many functions and variables
- Debugging was exhausting. For example, I never got blackjack during the coding so I had no idea if there would be any issue of it in real-time run
