# Blackjack
This Single-Page-App was created with JQuery. Just like what Blackjack should be, it's simple and fun.

## How to play
1. Input the amount of money you want to start with.
2. Set the bet amount.
3. Enjoy the game!

#### Player options:
- Hit: draw a card. You may draw more cards if not bust.
- Double: draw a card, double your bet, end your turn.
- Stand: do nothing, end your turn.
- Surrender: drop your hand, give up half of your bet.

## Nerd's thinking
#### Gains:
-Simple to design
-No requirement for other library support

#### Pains:
- The logic behind the game was relatively complicated
- Double values of Ace was the key but also a Bug's hotbed for the program
- Too many functions and variables
- Debugging was exhausting. For example, I never got blackjack during the coding so I had no idea if there would be any issue of it in real-time run

## Languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JQuery
